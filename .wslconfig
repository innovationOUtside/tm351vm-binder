# __Running Docker under WSL may cause your hold computer to slow down__  [contributed]:
#  a fix described in [How to Stop WSL2 from Hogging All Your Ram With Docker](https://medium.com/@lewwybogus/how-to-stop-wsl2-from-hogging-all-your-ram-with-docker-d7846b9c5b37) suggests:
#
# 1. creating a `.wslconfig` file in `c:\users\YOUR_PROFILE_NAME`
# 2.  from Powershell with admin rights, restart WSL2 by typing: `Restart-Service LxssManager`
# You should be okay setting `memory=4GB` although you may find things, particularly in the second half of the course, run more smoothly by setting `memory=4GB`

memory=4GB # Limits VM memory in WSL 2 to 4 GB
processors=2 # Makes the WSL 2 VM use two virtual processors
